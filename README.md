# E-Mensa-Webseite

This project was created by Linus Palm (https://github.com/LinusLinusDev) as part of the course "Databases and web technologies" at the FH Aachen.

To start this website, the directory "public" must be set as root directory. A MySQL database and PHP 7.4 or higher is required.In "config/db.php" and "config/orm.php" the database has to be configured. The necessary commands to set up the schema and the tables can be taken from "setup.sql".
